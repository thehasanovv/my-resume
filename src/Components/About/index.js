        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
          I am a co-founder and the CTO of Arthena where I build tools to price
          fine art quickly, accurately, and at scale. I also advise startups,
          and I invest in people and ideas through a small venture fund. I am
          particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety,
          imaging, social impact, and aerospace. If you think I can be helpful
          to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.
        </p>
        <h3>CURRENTLY</h3>
        <p>
          At Arthena, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape
          culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise
          products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like
          Dask, Dagster, TensorFlow, and spaCy. I primarily work as a data
          engineer but have broad experience across Arthenaâ€™s stack.
        </p>
